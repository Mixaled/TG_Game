It was the last one, interesting. I had never heard of the World's Elite Talent Academy. Could it be just a joke?
When I tried to find some information, it turned up nothing. So, okay, let's try to call it.
When I called, a voice gave me an address. Okay, it looks like a scam, but I am always interested in the theme of fraud,
so tomorrow I will go to the address to see those jerks.
