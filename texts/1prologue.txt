I'm {name} Taylor and I'm psychologist.During my childhood,
I {name} already understood most of the motives for the actions of other people,
understood when children are lying, and where adults are deceiving me, over time, I discovered that it is
not a problem for me to manipulate other people, their psyche is so fragile, so tender...
I began to increase the level of my knowledge with literature on psychology and the work of the brain.
I completed the entire school program at 10 without any problems and it took 5 more to complete Harvard University.
At the age of 15 I started working as a psychologist and because I have a very wealthy family with awesome psychologist
skills, I got good marketing and in 2 years I began to be included in the list of the best psychologists in the world
and who is going to stop me from achieving the first place??
